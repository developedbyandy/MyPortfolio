                <h2>Hey Guys! My name is Andy Charles </h2>
            </header>
            <p>I am a software developer residing in New York, NY</p>

            <p>I am a Rowan University alumni with a bachelors in advertising. I'm currently a student at Thinkful, and
                I am interested in the following subjects:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
            </ol>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                </header>
                <p>There's an interesting story about how I fell upon developing software. After graduating from Rowan
                    University in 2014, I went to work in telecommunications where I eventually became a store manager
                    for a cellphone company. After working in sales for about 4-5 years, I quit my job and went over to
                    work for iHeartMedia as an account executive.

                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic put the world on pause and put me out of a job. I started driving uber to pay
                    the bills while my best friend, who is a software engineer, started to talk me into learning how to
                    code. I had nothing better to do at the time as I was out of a job, so I took some free classes
                    online to teach me html and css, and then on to javascript. I caught the bug pretty early and caught
                    an attraction to designing websites.</p>

                <p>One thing lead to another and I found out about Thinkful, and started a prep course with them to
                    start my journey into becoming a software engineer, and I couldn't be happier! If you're looking to
                    hire a new developer or just looking for a friendly partner to work on projects with, please contact
                    me! I'd be happy to work with other developers on building an amazing software. </p>
